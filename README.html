<h1>Interactive Map For Single and Double Storey Terraced Property Sale
For 2022 In Melaka</h1>
<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>Given the current market dynamics, this project proposes the
development of an interactive map that will provide comprehensive data
on every single storey and double storey terraced property sold in
Melaka in 2022. This unique tool will empower housing developers to
formulate effective pricing and business strategies for future
developments in Melaka.</p>
<p>Property sales for single and double storey terraced in Melaka
recorded at RM869,477,476.00 with 2870 transactions in 2022. These
transactions represent freehold and leasehold terraced houses covering
457 scheme name/areas located in 3 districts namely Melaka Tengah, Alor
Gajah and Jasin.</p>

<h2>Terraced Property Outlook</h2>
<p>Single and double storey terraced residentials will be the property
segments to watch as Scientex Berhad had launched new project which is
Scientex Durian Tunggal 2 on 202 acres land while Parkland Group had
launched Bandar Botani Parkland in Jasin.</p>
<p>These two major residentials will be new offerings for future home
buyers looking for single or double storey terraced property in
Melaka.</p>

<p>In this part, we will begin our exploratory data analysis (EDA) by
viewing the dataset_2022.csv.</p>

|83.61 |230000 |</p>
<p>ðŸ”¶ Insights: The data contains 2870 rows with 10 columns.</p>
<p>We can observe that the dataset_2022.csv gives us the information of
property type, district, mukim, scheme name/area, month, year of
transcation date, tenure, land area, unit, main floor area and
transaction price. It is quite detailed for record of property
transactions.</p>
<h4>Data Cleaning</h4>
<p>However, we notice that the dataset uses square meter (sq.meter) to
represent the 'Land Area' and 'Main Floor Area'. Although this is
sufficient to perform EDA but the most common nomenclature used in the
market to represent the built size is in square feet measurement.</p>
<p>Thus we can convert the Land Area and Main Floor Area to square feet
(sq.ft). Also we can rename the Land Area to Land Size while the Main
Floor Area to Build Size.</p>
<p>Additionally, we have set column 'Month, Year of Transaction Date' to
a date column.</p>

<p>ðŸ”¶ Insights: We have renamed a few columns and converted values for
Land Size and Build Size to square feet measurement.</p>
<h4>Latitude and Longitude Positions</h4>
<p>Before an interactive map can be plotted, we must first obtain the
approximate latitude and longitude positions for every scheme name/area.
Since the dataset does not list the latitude and longitude positions, we
can obtain the information from the portal postcode.my. The portal has
an integration API with Google Maps.</p>
<p>| |Scheme Name/Area |Lat |Long |
|---|-----------------------|---------|-----------| |0 |TAMAN SERI BAYU
|2.384740 |102.212509 | |1 |TAMAN BKT INDAH |2.350550 |102.103860 | |2

HARMONI|2.335506 |102.266894 | |4 |TAMAN VISTA BELIMBING |2.328142
|102.266958 |</p>
<p>Ultimately, 457 scheme name/areas are available from the portal and
we can generate the positions. However, we need to combine latitude and
longitude positions into the original dataset.</p>

<p>ðŸ”¶ Insights: We have combined the latitude and longitute into the
dataset_2022.csv and renamed it to
melaka_terraced_property_sales_2022.csv.</p>
<p>Now that the dataset has been processed to a desire format, let us
explore the Melaka Property Sales Year 2022 by looking at the usefull
statistics below.</p>
<h2>2. Data Visualizations</h2>
<h4>Statistics</h4>
<p><img
src="https://github.com/wafiesa/Codes/blob/master/formatted_statistics.png"
alt="formatted_statistics.png" /></p>
<p>From the statistics summary above, we can observe that there were
2870 transactions made in the year 2022.</p>
<p>The maximum transaction price was recorded at RM1.2 million while the
minimum transaction price was clocked at RM90,000.00. The mean
transaction price is RM302,953.82.</p>
<p>Since the dataset represents single storey and double storey terraced
houses, we can visualize the data accroding to each type of
property.</p>
<h4>Boxplots</h4>
<p><img
src="https://github.com/wafiesa/Codes/blob/master/Boxplots_For_Transaction_Price.png"
alt="Boxplot_for_Transaction_Price.png" /></p>
<p>The boxplots above illustrate the property types according to the
districts. Furthermore, the boxplots also indicate the single storey
terraced and double storey terraced houses by land status (tenure) for
Freehold and Leasehold.</p>
<p>We can noticed that there are outliers it the boxplots but we want to
retain it for visualization in the map.</p>
<h4>Heatmap</h4>
<p><img
src="https://github.com/wafiesa/Codes/blob/master/Heatmap_District_Type.png"
alt="Heatmap_District_Type.png" /></p>
<p>The heatmap above shows the comparisson between property types and
the districts. Melaka Tengah sees more single storey terraced sold in
2022 at 969 units comparing to Jasin of 471 units while Alor Gajah of
375 units.</p>
<p>While sale transactions of double storey terraced sold in Melaka is
recorded highest in Melaka Tengah at 646 units followed by Alor Gajah of
313 and Jasin of 96 units.</p>
<p><img
src="https://github.com/wafiesa/Codes/blob/master/type_counts.png"
alt="type_counts.png" /></p>
<p>Overall, single storey terraced houses were sold a total of 1815
units compared to 1055 units of double storey terraced houses.</p>
<p><img
src="https://github.com/wafiesa/Codes/blob/master/Heatmap_District_Tenure.png"
alt="Heatmap_District_Tenure" /></p>
<p><img
src="https://github.com/wafiesa/Codes/blob/master/district_counts.png"
alt="district_count" /></p>
<p>From the heatmap of district versus tenure above we can observe that
majority transactions were concenrated in Melaka Tengah district with
1615 units sold followed by Alor Gajah at 688 units and Jasin at 567
units.</p>
<p>In the aspect of tenure, freehold property are more preferred with
1633 representing 854 units from Melaka Tengah, 468 units and 311 unit
for Jasin.</p>
<p>Meanwhile leasehold residentials were recorded at 1237 transactions
representing 761 units in Melaka Tengah, 256 units in Jasin and 220
units in Alor Gajah.</p>
<h4>Interactive Map</h4>
<p><img src="https://github.com/wafiesa/Codes/blob/master/map_all.png"
alt="map_all.png" />.<br><strong>Map 1: Hotspots for overall
locations.</strong></p>
<p>Using latitude and longitude information, we can scatter plot using
plotly.express package to visualize the approximate positions for every
scheme name/area. Off course, the interactive features do not available
here but by running the codes it is so much interesting. Your can obtain
some of information when you hover the map.</p>
<p>From the figure above, we can see that yellow circle represents
higher transaction price and easy to locate on the map. The position of
yellow circle represent most higher value transaction is located in
Taman Residence Lapan, Melaka Tengah.</p>
<p>Similarly, the most concentrated dots are located in Melaka Tengah as
it is near to central business district (CBD). This followed by the
Bandar Botani Parkland where it records 124 transactions in 2022.</p>
<p><img
src="https://github.com/wafiesa/Codes/blob/master/map_all_count.png"
alt="map_all_count.png" />.<br><strong>Map 2: Hotspots for
transactions.</strong></p>
<p>Figure above shows the transactions count over the scheme name/area.
It is contradictory with previous plot map since the most transactions
count were outside Melaka Tengah.</p>
<p>Specifically, the highest count was recorded at 154 transactions
located in Taman Scientex (Bukit Tambun Perdana) in the proximity Durian
Tunggal, Alor gajah.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/wafiesa/Codes/blob/master/map_1stry.png"
alt="map_1stry.png" />.<br><strong>Map 3: Hotspots for single storey
locations.</strong></p>
<p>Figure above displays the locations for every single storey terraced
sold in 2022. Ideally, Melaka Tengah seems to be very active in terms of
populated dots on the map.</p>
<p><img
src="https://github.com/wafiesa/Codes/blob/master/map_1stry_count.png"
alt="map_1stry_count.png" /><br><strong>Map 4: Hotspots for single
storey transactions.</strong></p>
<p>However, records show that Jasin was attractive enough to pull
homebuyers in 2022. The transactions count were recorded at 124 in
Botani Parkland alone. Additionally, high value residential such Country
Villa in Jasin was also contributing atleast 44 transactions.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/wafiesa/Codes/blob/master/map_2stry.png"
alt="map_2stry.png" />,<br><strong>Map 5: Hotspots for double storey
locations.</strong></p>
<p>In 2022, 1085 units of double storey terraced were sold in Melaka.
Although Taman Anggerik (Lot 71) in Melaka Tengah recorded the highest
market value for double storey of RM390,000.00 but it has serious
contender from Jasin which is Country Villas at RM380,000.00. Both the
residentials have almost identical build size of 1537.95 and 1471.75
respectively.</p>
<p><img
src="https://github.com/wafiesa/Codes/blob/master/map_2stry_count.png"
alt="map_2stry_count.png" />.<br><strong>Map 6: Hotspots for double
storey transactions.</strong></p>
<p>Nevertheless, Alor Gajah seems has stole a spotlight since the
highest transactions count was recorded in Taman Scientex (Bukit Tambun
Perdana). The new development in Alor Gajah has managed to attract
homebuyers to settle in the district.</p>
<h2>3. The Insights</h2>
<h4>Regression Analysis</h4>
<p><img
src="https://github.com/wafiesa/Codes/blob/master/distplot_price.png"
alt="distplot_price.png" /> <img
src="https://github.com/wafiesa/Codes/blob/master/distplot_build.png"
alt="distplot_build.png" /></p>
<p>From the density plot above, we can observe that the price range for
the transactions is concentrated between RM200,000.00 up to
RM300,000.00. Now, this explains that the density for build size is in
the region between 800 sq.ft to 900 sq.ft.</p>
<p>The densities demonstrate that high purchase volume for the
residential in the price range as well as the build size in concern.</p>
<p>Using linear regression model, we can determined the coefficient
among dependend and independend variables. From the computation in
sklearn.linear_model package, the results for the variables are as
follows:</p>
<p>Coefficient: [195.0251, 55.3691] Intercept: -12227.5884</p>
<p>Thus, the regression can be represent as in the model below:</p>
