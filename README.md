ðŸ”¶ Insights: The data contains 2870 rows with 10 columns.  

We can observe that the dataset_2022.csv gives us the information of property type, district, mukim, scheme name/area, month, year of transcation date, tenure, land area, unit, main floor area and transaction price. It is quite detailed for record of property transactions.

However, we notice that the dataset uses square meter (sq.meter) to represent the 'Land Area' and 'Main Floor Area'. Although this is sufficient to perform EDA but the most common nomenclature used in the market to represent the built size is in square feet measurement.

Thus we can convert the Land Area and Main Floor Area to square feet (sq.ft). Also we can rename the Land Area to Land Size while the Main Floor Area to Build Size. 

Additionally, we have set column 'Month, Year of Transaction Date' to a date column. 

|	|Property Type				|District	|Mukim				 |Scheme Name/Area			 |Month, Year of Transaction Date	|Tenure		|Land Size	|Unit	|Build Size	|Transaction Price|
|---|---------------------------|-----------|------------------- |---------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-------|-------------------|-----------------|

ðŸ”¶ Insights: We have renamed a few columns and converted values for Land Size and Build Size to square feet measurement. 

#### Latitude and Longitude Positions

Before an interactive map can be plotted, we must first obtain the approximate latitude and longitude positions for every scheme name/area. Since the dataset does not list the latitude and longitude positions, we can obtain the information from the portal postcode.my. The portal has an integration API with Google Maps.

Ultimately, 457 scheme name/areas are available from the portal and we can generate the positions. However, we need to combine latitude and longitude positions into the original dataset.

|	|Scheme Name/Area			|Lat	    |Long		|
|---|---------------------------|-----------|-----------|
|0	|TAMAN SERI BAYU	        |2.384740   |102.212509 |
|1	|TAMAN BKT INDAH			|2.350550	|102.103860 |
|2	|TAMAN BKT INDAH			|2.350550   |102.103860 |
|3	|TAMAN BELIMBING HARMONI	|2.335506	|102.266894 |
|4	|TAMAN VISTA BELIMBING   	|2.328142	|102.266958 |
